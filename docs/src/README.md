# Introduction

I decided to create this component because I could't find any single available free component for 
a context menu which instead of endlessly growing uses a scrolling for any level of opened sub-menu.

The component itself is built by using React and includes a dependency on react-bootstrap which mitigate 
the work with popup positioning.
